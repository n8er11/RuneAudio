Library Sorting
---
_Tested on RuneAudio 0.3 and 0.4b_

Fix incorrect library sorting when:
- [Webradio import](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio/tree/master/webradio)
- [MPD Upgrade](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio/tree/master/mpd)
- Some other things that could be fixed by changing sorting method:
	- from `(nameA < nameB)` to `nameA.localeCompare(nameB)`

**Install**  
from [**Addons Menu**](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio_Addons)
