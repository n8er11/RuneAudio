Music Library Browsing
---
_Tested on RuneAudio 0.3 and 0.4b_

- Breadcrumb path for shortcut jump to directories
- Index bar for quick scroll to directories
- Fix incorrect library sorting:
	- Sort non-english language
	- [Webradio import](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio/tree/master/webradio)
	- [MPD Upgrade](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio/tree/master/mpd)
	- MPD default sorting
	- Some other things that could be fixed by changing sorting method from `(nameA < nameB)` to `nameA.localeCompare(nameB)`

**Install**  
from [**Addons Menu**](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio_Addons)
