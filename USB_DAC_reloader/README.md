USB DAC Reloader
---

If RuneAudio cannot see an USB DAC that power on after boot. This addon loads saved settings without reboot.
- Power on DAC > boot to make it available for initial setup
- Save all settings of MPD configuration page
- Reload saved settings
- The DAC will be ready without reboot

(This addon is a part of [RuneUI GPIO](https://github.com/rern/RuneUI_GPIO) addon which turns on/off audio equipments in sequence and reloads DAC configuration automatically.)
