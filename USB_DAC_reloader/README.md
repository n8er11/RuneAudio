USB DAC Reloader
---

- RuneAudio does not list USB DACs that power on after boot.
- Click reload button next to **Audio output interface** to reload it without reboot.

(This addon is a part of [RuneUI GPIO](https://github.com/rern/RuneUI_GPIO) addon which turns on/off audio equipments in sequence and reloads DAC configuration automatically.)
