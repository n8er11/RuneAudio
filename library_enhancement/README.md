Library Enhancement
---
_Tested on RuneAudio 0.3 and 0.4b_

### Top bar
- **Breadcrumb path links** for shortcut jump to any **directory** in the path

### Right bar
- **Index bar** for quick scroll to directories

### Sorting
- Fix incorrect **Library sorting**:
	- Sort **non-english** language
	- After [**Webradio import**](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio/tree/master/webradio)
	- After [**MPD Upgrade**](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio/tree/master/mpd)
	- Some of MPD default sorting
- Songs in albums still, by default, be sorted by track number
**Install**  
from [**Addons Menu**](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio_Addons)
